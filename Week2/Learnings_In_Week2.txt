 Day1:
 I learned that PL/SQL is Oracle procedural extension of SQL that supports programming features like variables, conditions, loops, and error handling. I set up the Oracle SQL Developer environment and created a database connection to write and execute PL/SQL code. I understood the structure of PL/SQL blocks and the difference between anonymous and named blocks. I learned how to declare variables, use various data types, assign values, and apply %TYPE for dynamic type referencing. Additionally, I explored control flow using conditional statements (IF, CASE) and loops (LOOP, WHILE, FOR) to build logical and repeatable operations in PL/SQL programs.


 Day2:
 Exploring more in PL/SQL I have learned that cursors in PL/SQL are used to handle query results row-by-row. There are two types of Cursor 1)Implicit cursors which are automatically created by Oracle when a query runs 2)Explicit cursors which we define ourselves to control the query processing.The basic operations with cursors includes OPEN, FETCH and CLOSE. I also learned procedures and functions both are blocks of PL/SQL code that can be stored and reused. Procedures perform actions and can have input/output parameters while functions must return a value. I understood the types of parameters IN(input),OUT(output),and IN OUT (both input and output).I also learned about packages, which are a way to group related procedures, functions, variables, and cursors together. Packages have two parts: the specification (what is exposed) and the body (actual implementation) and they improve code organization and reusabilty.At the end i learned triggers, which are special procedures that automatically execute in response to certain events on a table such as BEFORE, AFTER,or INSTEAD OF an insert,update, or delete operation.Triggers are helpful for enforcing rules and automating actions in the database.
