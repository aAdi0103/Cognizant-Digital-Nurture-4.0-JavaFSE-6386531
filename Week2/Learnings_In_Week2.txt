Day1:
 I learned that PL/SQL is Oracle procedural extension of SQL that supports programming features like variables, conditions, loops, and error handling. I set up the Oracle SQL Developer environment and created a database connection to write and execute PL/SQL code. I understood the structure of PL/SQL blocks and the difference between anonymous and named blocks. I learned how to declare variables, use various data types, assign values, and apply %TYPE for dynamic type referencing. Additionally, I explored control flow using conditional statements (IF, CASE) and loops (LOOP, WHILE, FOR) to build logical and repeatable operations in PL/SQL programs.
